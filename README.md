# The Sparks Foundation - Data Science & Business Analytics Internship

## Task 1: Predicting Student Percentage Based on Study Hours

### Introduction
This repository contains my solution to Task 1 as part of The Sparks Foundation's Data Science & Business Analytics Internship. The objective of the task is to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.

### Dataset
The dataset provided includes two columns: 'Hours' and 'Percentage'. It represents the number of study hours a student has invested and the corresponding percentage achieved.

### Files
- "tsf task 1 linear regression.ipynb": Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, model training, and predictions.
- "http://bit.ly/w-data": URL of dataset used for analysis.

### Libraries Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization
- sklearn.metrics: Machine learning models.

### Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to predictive modeling in data science, showcasing the application of machine learning to predict student performance based on study hours.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to The Sparks Foundation for providing this insightful internship opportunity.
